  Systems Integrator @ <a href="https://cornell.edu">Cornell University ↗</a>
  Building internal applications, automations and supporting software.

  I specialize in extending, automating and creating software.
  Everything from building modules to integrate AI with robots,
  to scripts that automate an existing asset tracking database,
  to full stack applications to manage other applications.

  Like my text editor, I work across
  all operating systems via the command line.

  Interested in projects and remote opportunities

  <span class="subsection-name">cases</span>

    <span class="subsection-name">Interfolio Dossier Builder</span>
    Automated assembly of faculty tenure review packets

    Built a full-stack system in three languages.
    React frontend submits jobs to a Node.js/Express
    API, which queues work through BullMQ and Redis.
    A Python worker pulls documents through Interfolio's
    HMAC-SHA1 authenticated API, classifies them with
    regex pattern matching, merges PDFs with PyPDF2,
    and generates nested bookmarks.
    23K lines across 127 files and 6 languages.

    Replaced a multi-day manual process with a
    5-minute automated run.

    <span class="dim">Python, Node.js, React, BullMQ, Redis,
    PyPDF2, Interfolio API, MSSQL, Vite</span>


    <span class="subsection-name">Device Asset Sync</span>
    Bi-directional inventory tracking across 1,300+ devices

    Wrote a bi-directional sync between Jamf MDM
    and Snipe-IT in PowerShell. The Mac agent uses
    an OOP class with exponential backoff, OAuth
    token refresh, and request throttling. A separate
    Windows agent deployed via Group Policy reports
    system info at logon.

    1,300+ devices tracked at 95%+ accuracy.
    Eliminated manual inventory entirely.

    <span class="dim">PowerShell, Jamf Pro API, Snipe-IT API,
    Group Policy</span>


    <span class="subsection-name">App Security Manager</span>
    RBAC dashboard replacing legacy ColdFusion permissions

    Built an RBAC dashboard with a three-tier role
    model (Developer, Owner, Admin). LDAP live search
    with drag-and-drop user assignment. Transactional
    SQL for cascading permission deletes across linked
    tables. Auth runs through the university's
    Shibboleth/SAML reverse proxy.
    3,400 lines serving two colleges from one interface.

    Access changes take under a minute. Replaced
    a ColdFusion system in use for over a decade.

    <span class="dim">Node.js, Express, MSSQL, LDAP, Shibboleth/SAML</span>


    <span class="subsection-name">NAO Bot Natural Conversation</span>
    Conversational humanoid robot for research demo

    Connected NAO's onboard microphone to OpenAI
    Whisper for transcription, routed text through
    GPT for response generation, and piped output
    back through NAO's animated speech engine for
    synchronized voice and gestures.

    Delivered a working proof-of-concept for an
    NSF grant proposal.
